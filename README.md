# JobRunnerInPython
A web application to upload and run your python jobs as background tasks on the server.

A crontab expression field replaces the interval field to achieve more flexibility already.

You probably don't want to run app.py in auto_reload and debug modes, so you can modify the last few lines of app.py accordingly.
